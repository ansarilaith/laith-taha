## Functions

The FunBoard comes with software to support all of the attached board peripherals like the MicroSD card, the leds, beeper, etc.
There are also a lot of convenience functions included for common events such as connecting to WiFi, file and directory management, and using the Real-Time-Clock.

Most of the class names are self-explanatory, but be sure to have a look at the obscure ones like **st**, which has lots of handy functions for exploring the file system, and **esp32**, which has some *ESP32-specific* functions.
