# YouTube Projects Code

This repository hosts the code I use in projects from my YouTube channel [ClaytonDarwin](https://www.youtube.com/claytondarwin).

I use a **Debian-Linux**-based desktop computer for testing/running all the **Python3** scripts. I don't know it they will work on Windows and/or Mac OSX.

I typically use an **ESP32** for all **MicroPython** scripts.

I don't have a lot of time to maintain/update/improve this resository. I'm trying to keep all my new code here, and as I have time I'm going back and adding old code (from older projects).

Feel free to use the code however you like. If it is a great benefit to you, be sure to send me something nice, like money or a bottle of wine (or at least a message).

Cheers,

Clayton
