# YouTube Projects Code

This is a repository to host the code used I use in projects from my YouTube channel [ClaytonDarwin](https://www.youtube.com/claytondarwin).

I use a Debian Linux based desktop computer for testing/running all the Python scripts. I have no way of knowing if any of these scripts will work on Windows and/or Mac OS X.

I typically use an ESP32 for all MicroPython scripts.

I don't have a lot of time to maintain/update/improve this resository. I'm trying to keep all my new code here, and as I have time I'm going back and adding old code (from older projects).

Feel free to use the code however you like. If it is a great benefit to you, be sure to send me something nice, like money or a bottle of wine (or at least a message).

Cheers,

Clayton
