# Clayton's PCB Shop

Welcome to Clayton's PCB Shop. This repository hosts the code for projects on my YouTube channel [ClaytonDarwin](https://www.youtube.com/claytondarwin).

**Note**: This code is in different stages of completion. It may or may not be functional, depending on where I left it last.

I'm using a **Debian-Linux**-based desktop computer for testing and running all the **Python3** scripts, and I typically use an **ESP32** for all the **MicroPython** scripts.

Feel free to use the code however you like. If it is a great benefit to you, be sure to send me something nice, like a friendly message, a bottle of wine, or even money.

Cheers,

Clayton
