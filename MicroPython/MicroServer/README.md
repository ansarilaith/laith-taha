# MicroServer

This is exact code I use to run the Beaker server. 

## UPDATE 2024-02-10

- Micropython 1.19
- Funboard libraries removed. Runs on any ESP32 with Micropython.
- Added a response column so Beaker can answer your messages (if he feels like it).
- Added an online editor for me to edit the guest entries.
- Added an EZIot DNS thread to keep the DNS server updated.
- Nicer Color scheme.
- Other things.
