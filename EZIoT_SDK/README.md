# EZToT Toolkit

I'm starting to write these docs. Keep checking back.

## What is EZIoT? 

The file `eziot.py` is a script that will run with both Python3 and MicroPython. It functions as a **S**oftware **D**evelopment **K**it or **SDK** that allows the user to easily interact with the **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface or **API** on the `eziot.link` website.

The **API** on the `eziot.link` website allows users to create an account where they can easily upload data from their internet-connected projects and devices. The uploaded data can then be downloaded and used by your other devices or your desktop. The `eziot.link` website is basically a cloud location where you can drop off your data so that it can be picked up later by your other devices.

## What Can I Do?

The `eziot.py` SDK in combination with the `eziot.link` API will allow your upload data from anywhere with an internet connection and use it anywhere else with an internet connection. Here are some of the specific things you can do:

1. **Upload Data** - You can upload up to 1024 "rows" of data. For each row of data you can include 6 items or values: `[**group_name**,**device_name**,**data1**,**data2**,**data3**,**data4**]`.
