I'm starting to write these docs. Keep checking back.

## What is EZIoT? 

The file `eziot.py` is a script that will run with both Python3 and MicroPython. It functions as a **S**oftware **D**evelopment **K**it or **SDK** that allows the user to easily interact with the **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface or **API** on the `eziot.link` website.

The **API** on the `eziot.link` website allows users to create an account where they can easily upload data from their internet-connected projects and devices. The uploaded data can then be downloaded and used by other devices or your desktop.
